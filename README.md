## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I’m Afridi — an AI/ML engineer and independent researcher obsessed with building **verifiable, trustworthy, safe AI systems**.

* 🧠 Founder & CTO at **XCL3NT**, an AI-first commerce brand
* 🤖 Researcher behind **Dynamic Chain-of-Thought Reward Models (D-CoT)** — [Read D-CoT](https://zenodo.org/records/16554886)
* 🛡️ Focus: **AI Safety & Trust** — designing systems with evidence, evaluation, and safeguards by default
* 🌍 Remote-ready and open to relocation (US/EU/NZ/SEA)

> *Mission: Make AI safer, more transparent, and actually helpful to humanity.* 🌱

---

## 🧪 My Research Focus

* **AI Safety & Trust**: principled safeguards, red-teaming, abstain/route policies, and post-hoc verification
* Verifiable QA systems (answers backed by evidence)
* Model behavior analysis & safety alignment
* Evaluation frameworks (metrics, gates, nightly reports)
* Human-data pipelines (collection → curation → evals)
* Cost/freshness routing and retrieval-generation hybrids

## 💌 Let’s Collaborate

If you’re building **frontier models, eval frameworks, or safety tooling** — I’d love to collaborate.
Let’s make AI **safer, smarter, and actually trustworthy.** 🛡️

> *“AI safety isn’t a checkbox — it’s a responsibility.”* – Me, probably during a caffeine high ☕😄

---

## 🔒 AI Safety & Trust

* Build **evidence-bound** systems (claims must cite sources)
* Add **prompt contracts** + **CI gates** for regressions
* Use **nightly evals** with safety and calibration metrics
* Prefer **abstain/route** over confident nonsense
* Ship **receipts**: versions, seeds, costs, and checks for replayability
